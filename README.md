This is a program that assigns seats on a flight of the airline’s only plane.

The program is displaying the following alternatives: "Type 1 for Buying First Class Ticket", "Type 2 for Buying Economy Class Ticket", and "Type 3 for Ticket Validation".

Typing 1 is assigning a seat in the first-class section (seats 1–5).
Typing 2 is assigning a seat in the economy section (seats 6–10).
Typing 3 is taking a seat ID from user and validating whether the seat is sold or not.

Program also displays person’s seat number and determines whether it is in the first-class or economy section of the plane.

Program also indicates “The plane is now full” when all seats are sold.

When the economy section is full, application asks the person if it is acceptable to be placed in the first-class section (and vice versa). If yes, it makes the appropriate seat assignment. If no, it displays the message "Next flight leaves in 3 hours."

A sample screenshot is also added.
